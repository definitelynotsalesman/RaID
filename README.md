# **RaID - Simple GUI that uses the Hypixel API to get in-game prices for all matching items**

To run: 
  1. pip/pip3 install requirements.txt (depending on OS, modification may be needed)
  2. python/python3 main.py

Will use PyInstaller to create a standalone executable in the future. Functionality is largely complete but has yet to be added to the github. 

Goals and Improvements:
Upon clicking icons, it should be able to efficiently fetch from table all tuples with the entry, and translate information from them accordingly.
